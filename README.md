# Weekend Movie Sagas!

## Description

In this project, upon install and initialization it will direct you to a page that lists all of the movie posters and titles of movies stored on a database. From there, when you click on a specific movie poster, it will redirect you to a movie details page for that single movie and show you all the details (title, poster, genres, descriptions) on the page. You are then able to click a button on the Details page and go back to the list of movies once again and then select a new movie to show all the details for.
